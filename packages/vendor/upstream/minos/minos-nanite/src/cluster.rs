//! Cluster-DAG data types — the frozen, GPU-agnostic contract produced by the
//! baker ([`crate::bake`]) and consumed by the runtime pass (added in N1).
//!
//! Pure data + `glam`; no `ash`, no GPU. Positions and bounding-sphere centers
//! are stored **patch-origin-relative** (f32), matching minos's camera-relative
//! precision convention: the absolute planet-space origin lives in
//! [`ClusterAsset::patch_origin`] (f64) and the per-frame camera-relative
//! translation is applied at draw time.
