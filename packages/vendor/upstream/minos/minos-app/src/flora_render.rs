// flora_render.rs — flora-OWNED Vulkan sub-renderer (behind `--features flora`).
//
// ponytail: this is the SMALLEST self-contained sub-renderer that re-renders the
// CURRENT tree+ground+sky through pipelines flora OWNS, mirroring the
// `egui-ash-renderer` precedent (gui.rs): it manages its OWN VkShaderModules,
// VkDescriptorSetLayouts, VkPipelineLayout, VkPipelines, descriptor pool, and a
// per-frame uniform ring, using ONLY raw handles from minos-rhi
// (device_handle/instance_handle/physical_device/swapchain_format/msaa_samples/
// current_command_buffer/...). It records into the viewer's begin_rendering
// instance via the raw command buffer — exactly like egui's `cmd_draw`.
//
// WHY this exists (the enabler for shadows/IBL/bloom/wind): minos-rhi's
// `create_graphics_pipeline` HARDCODES the pipeline layout to a SINGLE set
// (set0 = FrameUniforms; pipeline.rs:132) and `bind_pipeline` binds only set0.
// That blocks flora pipelines from sampling a shadow map / IBL cubes or reading
// bone buffers. This module builds its OWN VkPipelineLayout = [set0, set1] so
// set1 is AVAILABLE for those resources. THIS STAGE only proves visual parity:
// set1 is created (a shadow-map sampler slot) but bound to nothing and unused by
// the shaders yet. The next stages fill set1 + add the shadow pass.
//
// DELETABLE-FLORA CONTRACT: every Vulkan object here is owned by `FloraRenderer`
// and freed in `destroy()` (called by the viewer before Rhi teardown). Deleting
// flora = dropping this file + flora_view.rs + staging.rs + the
// `#[cfg(feature="flora")]` wiring. minos-rhi's terrain/nanite path is untouched.
//
// The pipeline state below is a BYTE-FOR-BYTE copy of minos's main-pass pipeline
// (pipeline.rs): reversed-Z depth GREATER, depth clear 0, D32_SFLOAT depth,
// color = swapchain format, MSAA = rhi.msaa_samples(), the fixed 4×vec3 vertex
// layout, cull BACK / front-face CCW, dynamic viewport+scissor — so the tree
// renders identically to today, just through flora-owned objects.
