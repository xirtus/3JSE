//! Deterministic surface scatter for procedural trees (Phase B, `--features flora`).
//!
//! World-deterministic: a tree's existence / position / yaw / scale is a pure hash
//! of its lat-lon grid cell, so walking around never reshuffles the grove — only
//! the visible window (a radius around the player) slides. No LOD, no instancing:
//! the caller draws ONE shared species mesh once per returned instance via
//! `FloraView::record_at`.
//!
//! ponytail: lat-lon cells distort near the poles (fixed angular `dlon` → cells
//! bunch up there) and there is NO hardware instancing (draw cost is ~N×2). Both
//! are fine for a walk-among-trees grove on the mid-latitude surface; revisit with
//! a cube-sphere cell id + instanced draw if trees ever need planet-wide coverage.
