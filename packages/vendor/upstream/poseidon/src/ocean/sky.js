// The sky is a baked panorama (public/sky/), replacing the procedural gradient
// and fBm cloud decks entirely.
//
// skyColor() is called from three places and has to hold up in all of them:
//   - the sky dome (dir = camera-relative view ray)
//   - the ocean's Fresnel reflection (dir = reflected ray, y clamped just above
//     0, so it lands in the compressed near-horizon band and the wave slopes
//     smear cloud structure across the water)
//   - scene.fogNode in atmosphere.js (dir = camera -> fragment, so mostly
//     *below* the horizon; everything under y=0 has to resolve to the same haze
//     value the sky just above the line has, or the far water separates from
//     the sky instead of dissolving into it)

// The equirect panorama, not the cube faces shipped beside it. The cube would
// avoid the wrap seam for free, but this pack's faces are not in three's axis
// convention — aiming the camera straight down the measured sun vector does not
// find the sun in them — and guessing a rotation is worse than not needing one.
// The equirect convention IS verified: equirectUV is three's own, the sun
// position below was measured through that same convention, and the sky's sun
// lands exactly at the far end of the water's glitter path.
//
// Mipmaps are off deliberately. With them on, the u wrap prints a vertical seam
// down the frame: the UV derivative spikes from ~0 to 1 across the wrap column,
// the hardware reads that as an enormous footprint and drops to the coarsest
// mip, leaving a blurred stripe in the sky. Off, the seam is gone. The cost is
// minification aliasing, which this sky can afford — it is low-frequency
// painted art, and the ocean's reflection ray already relaxes toward flat with
// roughness before it gets here.
// Loaded LAZILY, at the first skyColor() call, because the file is chosen by
// params.sky and main.js applies a shot's overrides after module import — a
// module-level load would bake the default sky into every `?p={"sky":...}`
// capture.

// first couple of degrees above the line, so distant water dissolves into the
// sky it actually meets and the value stays continuous across y = 0.

// An 8-bit panorama peaks at 253, so its sun carries no more energy than a white
// cloud and every reflection of it comes back flat. Expand the top of the range
// back into HDR so the water gets a specular path with punch and ACES has
// something to roll off. Reconstruction, not a look — the alternative is an .hdr
// source. The knee is deliberately high: this sky's solar glow is broad and
// painted, and a low knee expands half the cloud deck into a white plate.
//
// The recovered energy is TINTED, and that is the half this was missing. Eight
// bits do not just lose the sun's magnitude, they lose its COLOUR: the disc
// clips, and what clips first is the channel that was brightest, so the core
// measures 0xfdffe1 — near-white — while the same sun read where it is NOT
// clipped, along its own azimuth in the first few degrees of elevation, measures
// 0xffd395. Multiplying the clipped white by eleven therefore reconstructs
// eleven times the wrong colour, and since a specular reflection of the disc is
// most of the glitter path, the sea's brightest highlights came back at a
// measured ratio of 1.000 / 0.994 / 0.984 under a sun that is 1.000 / 0.827 /
// 0.584. The light source and the light disagreed.
//
// So the ADDED energy carries the sun's own hue while the base sample passes
// through untouched. The quartic on `over` does the gating for free: a cumulus
// top at 0.92 of range gets a 14% lift and is barely tinted, the solar core gets
// the full eleven and is tinted completely. The hue is read from the sunColor
// uniform rather than pinned here, so the GUI swatch moves the sun in the sky
// and the sunlight on the water together, and they cannot drift apart again.
// Correcting this alone was NOT enough, and the reason is worth recording
// because it is where two days of plausible-looking fixes went. Tinting the
// reconstruction moved the measured highlight ratio by about one per cent. So
// did lowering the glitter's white mix, and exempting the sun from the
// reflection's warm-desaturation, and pushing the reconstructed hue to a power.
// All four are correct at the source and all four were invisible, because the
// frame was tone mapped with ACES: a reconstructed disc lands eight to twelve
// times over its white point, and up there ACES returns all three channels
// within a couple of per cent of each other whatever colour went in. The light
// was already golden in linear space — the curve was painting it white on the
// way out. See the tone mapping note in main.js.
// Per-sky — see SKIES in params.js. Read at first use, alongside the texture.

// This panorama's zenith blue is saturated enough that the ACES input matrix
// drives its red channel negative, which clamps to 0 and prints a hard-edged
// region boundary across an otherwise smooth gradient — measured at 8.11% of the
// `away` frame before this. Pulling a few percent toward the colour's own
// luminance puts it back inside the gamut the tone curve can carry. The number
// is set by the probe, not by eye: raise it until tools/probe.mjs reports
// clipR 0.00 on every preset, and no further.
