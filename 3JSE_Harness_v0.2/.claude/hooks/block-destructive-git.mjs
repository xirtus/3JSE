/**
 * Refuses the git commands that can destroy work nobody has committed.
 *
 * Adopted from the vibe game engine web-starter-kit (MIT):
 * https://github.com/vibegameengine/web-starter-kit — .claude/hooks/block-destructive-git.mjs
 * The mechanism is theirs, unchanged; the rule it enforces is our AGENTS.md
 * "Never delete work wholesale": reverting is done by writing the reverse
 * change, or by putting the current state somewhere safe first. Never by
 * asking git to discard whatever happens to be there.
 *
 * Written after `git checkout -- <file>` was run on a shared working tree to
 * undo one change. It did undo it. It also threw away every other uncommitted
 * edit in that file, and the agent that ran it could not say whose those were -
 * several sessions work in a tree like this at once. There is no undo: git keeps
 * no record of a working-tree file it overwrote.
 *
 * The first version matched the subcommand with one flat regex per name. An
 * adversarial pass found it both too loose and too tight, and the two failures
 * feed each other: `git switch main`, `git -C other checkout main`,
 * `X=$(git checkout main)` and `git worktree remove --force` walked straight
 * through, while `git checkout -b feature/x` - which creates a branch, destroys
 * nothing, and which our commit-early rule requires - was refused, along with
 * `git stash list` and `git reset --soft`. A guard that blocks the safe form of
 * an operation teaches the reader to route around it, and the route around it
 * passes the dangerous form too.
 *
 * So this one tokenizes rather than pattern-matching a line, and judges the
 * subcommand together with the flags that decide whether it touches the working
 * tree.
 *
 * Reads a PreToolUse payload on stdin and answers with a permission decision.

 * fixed it, for the same reason. A guard nobody can write about is a guard
 * nobody can document, and the way round it is not to weaken the match.
